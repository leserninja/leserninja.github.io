# This file provides documentation or notes regarding the assets used in the project.

Day one I started this website project and worked on front.
Day two, today I made the js so that the sidebar worked and I also made different files for the tabs, I also made the css to my liking. After that I fixed the link tree.
Day three, I only made the about me tab nothing more so I only fixed the css background there and the text.

#TODO: In the future I might add more tabs and features and mabye change names of things.
